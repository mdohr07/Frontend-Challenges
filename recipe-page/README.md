# Frontend Mentor â€“ Recipe Page

This is my solution to the [Recipe Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge focuses on semantic HTML and applying modern CSS layout and design practices.

## ðŸ›  Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties (variables)  
- Mobile-first responsive layout  
- Flexbox  
- JavaScript  

## âœ¨ Extra Features Added

In addition to the required layout and styling from the original Frontend Mentor challenge, I implemented the following:

### ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode Toggle
- A **toggle button** in the top-right corner lets users switch between light and dark mode.
- The mode switch is handled with **vanilla JavaScript** and CSS class toggling.
- Button text updates dynamically to reflect the current mode (e.g., shows "light mode" when dark mode is active).
- Smooth transition effects applied with `transition` in CSS.
- Fully responsive and accessible.

### â™¿ Accessibility Considerations
- Proper semantic structure (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Clear color contrast in both light and dark modes
- Button is keyboard-accessible

These extras were added to make the page more interactive and to help me practice JavaScript.
