# Frontend Challenges

This repository contains all the frontend coding challenges I complete, mainly from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).  
Instead of creating a separate repository for each challenge, I collect them here in individual project folders.



## 📁 Projects

### ✅ Blog preview card

A simple HTML & CSS challenge focused on layout and styling. I also added extra features like buttons to go back and forth.
