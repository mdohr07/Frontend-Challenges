# Frontend Challenges

This repository contains all the frontend coding challenges I complete, mainly from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).  
Instead of creating a separate repository for each challenge, I collect them here in individual project folders.

## Recipe page
 The challenge Recipe Page focuses on semantic HTML and applying modern CSS layout and design practices. I added an option to toggle dark mode.
